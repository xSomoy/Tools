FUp your annoying Friend....

There was a tread going on facebook that they will do a ridiculas thing if a huge amount of comment (usually 5k or 10k) a post gets. So i wrote a linux automation shell script to comment on post as frequently as facebook allows. "xdotool" necessary to mimic keyboard input. so install it first. then go to the post and run the script and point your cursor on a comment box. and then sleep. you can customize delay time and the text to comment. Thanks me later.
