# Transporter
`
Transfer Files While You Are Sleeping....
`  
  
***[Linux Only]*** 

I was pulling of some data from a dying Hard Disk. The data transfer speed was slow as hell.
Not only that GUI was facing sevaral errors dude to hdd's condition. Not only that I had to keep on my pc for whole night and monitor errors. So I wrote a script to transfer files, tacle the errors and shut the computer when all done. Later i rewrite the whole thing so that others can use it easily. And here it is.

# cMonitor
`
Live Internet Connection Test And Monitor Packet Loss.... 
`  
***[Linux Only]***

I was facing problems with my internet connection test. So wrote a simple infinite fucntion to continiously send data pack to google local dns server ( 8.8.8.8 ) and display status of every pack. After sending 100 packs it will display a general 'Ping' result for 3 seconds and run the function again. Helps you to monitor your internet connection live. ```Ctrl+c``` to quit. 


# autoComment
`
FUp your annoying Friend....
`  
  
***[Linux Only]***

There was a tread going on facebook that they will do a ridiculas thing if a huge amount of comment (usually 5k or 10k) a post gets. So i wrote a linux automation shell script to comment on post as frequently as facebook allows. "xdotool" necessary to mimic keyboard input. so install it first. then go to the post and run the script and point your cursor on a comment box. and then sleep. you can customize delay time and the text to comment. Thanks me later.



# Password Strength Score
`
Check how strong your password is....
`  
  
 
i was measuring password strength using a website. But they where providing individual score. So every single time i had to calculate overall score. So i literally recreating the site including total score calculation. Yes I'm this much lazy. ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡

And yes i wasnâ€™t feeling secure to put my passwords on a site. So i took their formula and making this an offline app instead of updating my passwords. And its 4:25am here. ðŸ™ƒ
