Transfer Files While You Are Sleeping....
`  
  
 
I was pulling of some data from a dying Hard Disk. The data transfer speed was slow as hell.
Not only that GUI was facing sevaral errors dude to hdd's condition. Not only that I had to keep on my pc for whole night and monitor errors. So I wrote a script to transfer files, tacle the errors and shut the computer when all done. Later i rewrite the whole thing so that others can use it easily. And here it is.

Live Internet Connection Test And Monitor Packet Loss....
`  

I was facing problems with my internet connection test. So wrote a simple infinite fucntion to continiously send data pack to google local dns server ( 8.8.8.8 ) and display status of every pack. After sending 100 packs it will display a general 'Ping' result for 3 seconds and run the function again. Helps you to monitor your internet connection live. ```Ctrl+c``` to quit.
