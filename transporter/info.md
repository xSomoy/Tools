Transfer Files While You Are Sleeping....

I was pulling of some data from a dying Hard Disk. The data transfer speed was slow as hell.
Not only that GUI was facing sevaral errors dude to hdd's condition. Not only that I had to keep on my pc for whole night and monitor errors. So I wrote a script to transfer files, tacle the errors and shut the computer when all done. Later i rewrite the whole thing so that others can use it easily. And here it is.
