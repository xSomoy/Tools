Live Internet Connection Test And Monitor Packet Loss....
`  

I was facing problems with my internet connection test. So wrote a simple infinite fucntion to continiously send data pack to google local dns server ( 8.8.8.8 ) and display status of every pack. After sending 100 packs it will display a general 'Ping' result for 3 seconds and run the function again. Helps you to monitor your internet connection live. ```Ctrl+c``` to quit.
